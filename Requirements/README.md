# Requirements
## Introduction
Many automobile industry now use air conditioners to avoid heat, and heaters are equally important in cold places. This will keep the person driving in a comfortable position.
## Abstract
The coldness control framework is fundamentally used to control the temperature of a vehicle seat. At the point when a client or driver of the vehicle gets situated on a vehicle, the button sensor gets enacted. From that point onward, the client gains admittance to turn on the coldness. The temperature sensor continues to screen the temperature and sends the simple worth to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the simple contribution of the temperature sensor and results a temperature esteem through sequential correspondence. Every one of the exercises of the control framework are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328.
## Advantages
Comfortable driving experience.
Faster cooling of seats and reduced dependancy of AC .
## Disadvantages
It is not automatic.
## SWOT 
### Strength
Capacity to change temperature setting through the code
Manual control of temperature change
Manual exchanging activity
### Weakness
No criticism circle to really take a look at temperature
Neglects to recognize glitch
### Opportunity
To adapt with the AC environment settings
To detect error if malfunctions
### Threat
Excessive heating can damage the sea
# 4W's and 1H
## WHO
The driver and travelers.
## WHAT
cooled seats for more solace.
## WHEN
Exceptionally powerful during cold winters and hot summers.
## WHERE
In the seats of the vehicle.
## HOW
cooling framework inside the seat
